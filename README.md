Hi, I'm Oswell👨‍💻

I am 21 years old, I am a student at the Central University of Venezuela in the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences for the title of Economist. I am currently studying the 7th semester and I am doing internships at the Development Bank of Latin America - CAF, in the direction of sectoral analysis,there I work in data analysis through the tools of R, Power bi and stata for the generation of Knowledge that helps internal customers in optimizing operations.

I really enjoy learning about data science, it aroused my interest during the pandemic and I intend to develop myself in this field, with a view to playing a role that allows solving problems through the use of data.

I am now learning a specialized program at johns hopkins university in data science based on R, with a view to doing a specialized program in python 🐍.
