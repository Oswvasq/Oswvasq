Hi, I'm Oswelüë®‚Äçüíª

I am 21 years old, I am a student at the Central University of Venezuela in the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences to graduate as an Economist. I am currently studying the 7th semester and I am doing internships at the Development Bank of Latin America - CAF in the direction of sectoral analysis, there I work in data analysis through programs such as R, Stata and Power bi, this with the objective of generate knowledge that allows optimizing internal operations and providing more information to internal customers.

I really enjoy learning about data science, it is an area that aroused my interest during the Covid-19 pandemic, my intention is to develop myself in this field with a view to playing a role that allows solving business problems through the use of data.

I am now doing a specialized 10-course program on Coursera of Johns Hopkins University in R-based data science.
